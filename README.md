## 🌊 About Melon Robotics

Melon Robotics is building the future of ocean intelligence by engineering autonomous systems that sense, analyze, and interact with the maritime environment—at scale and in real time. We're on a mission to turn the ocean into a connected, intelligent ecosystem by deploying affordable, modular, and highly capable robotic platforms.

We believe the ocean is the final frontier for scalable autonomy and meaningful machine intelligence. Our work helps governments, researchers, and private operators get data faster, act smarter, and reduce human risk in extreme environments.

## 🛰️ Flagship Products

### 🐟 **Melon Scout**
**Scout** is our ultra-portable, AI-driven Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), designed for rapid deployment and intelligent mission execution. Scout is the ocean’s equivalent of a reconnaissance drone: compact, modular, and swarm-capable.

#### Key Features:
- Real-time adaptive AI mission control
- Long-range rajiform-inspired locomotion
- Interchangeable payload modules (imaging, sonar, chemical sampling)
- Edge-computing for onboard processing
- Designed for ease of recovery and redeployment

#### Use Cases:
- Coastal surveillance and interdiction
- Environmental monitoring and research
- Pipeline and infrastructure inspection
- Disaster response and search operations

### 🧠 **Melon Fever**
**Fever** is our swarm autonomy system—a tightly coordinated network of Melon Scouts operating as an intelligent collective. Fever enables persistent ocean presence and exponentially scalable data collection.

#### Key Features:
- Acoustic and RF mesh communication protocols
- Swarm-based mission planning and coordination
- Shared situational awareness and data fusion
- Multi-agent behavior learning and optimization
- Compatible with satellite and USV uplink for relay

#### Use Cases:
- Large-area search and mapping
- Subsea networked surveillance
- Fleet-scale data harvesting
- Collaborative exploration and patrol missions
