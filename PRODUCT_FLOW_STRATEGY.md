## Core Narrative Arc

### The Story We Tell

**Act I: The Challenge (Landing Page)**
- The ocean is the final frontier for human operations
- Extreme depths, unpredictable conditions, mission-critical stakes
- Current solutions are fragmented, expensive, or inadequate
- **Hook**: "When operations go underwater, failure isn't an option"

**Act II: The Solution (Products/Services Pages)**
- We engineer precision systems that work where others fail
- Products solve specific operational challenges
- Services provide end-to-end operational support
- **Connection**: Products + Services = Complete operational capability

**Act III: The Outcome (Individual Pages)**
- Real-world impact: Safety, efficiency, mission success
- Proven track record with defense, commercial, research
- **Resolution**: "Your operations, elevated to the next level"

## User Journey Mapping

### Primary Personas

1. **Defense/Government Operations**
   - Need: Surveillance, inspection, data collection
   - Pain: Risk to personnel, limited visibility, time constraints
   - Solution: Scout AUV + ROV Inspection + Ocean Data

2. **Commercial Marine Operators**
   - Need: Hull inspection, maintenance, compliance
   - Pain: Downtime costs, safety risks, documentation requirements
   - Solution: ROV Inspection + Photogrammetry + Safety Standards

3. **Research Institutions**
   - Need: Environmental data, mapping, monitoring
   - Pain: Limited access, high costs, data gaps
   - Solution: Ocean Data Services + Scout AUV + 3D Mapping

4. **Port/Municipal Authorities**
   - Need: Infrastructure inspection, environmental monitoring
   - Pain: Budget constraints, scheduling, compliance
   - Solution: Subscription Services + ROV Inspection

## Page Flow Redesign

### Landing Page → Problem Introduction
**Current**: Lists products/services
**New**: Introduces the challenge and mission

**Structure:**
1. Hero: "The Ocean Demands Precision" (emotional hook)
2. The Challenge: What makes underwater operations difficult
3. Our Approach: How we solve it differently
4. Solutions Overview: Products + Services as integrated system
5. Trust Indicators: Defense, commercial, research use cases
6. CTA: "Explore Solutions" → Products OR "See How We Help" → Services

### Products Page → Solution Showcase
**Current**: Technical catalog
**New**: Problem → Solution → Outcome

**Structure:**
1. Hero: "Technology That Works Where Others Fail"
2. Problem-Solution Matrix:
   - **Communication Challenges** → BlackBox
   - **Human Limitations** → PneumaForce
   - **Autonomous Operations** → Melon Scout
3. How They Work Together: Integrated ecosystem
4. Technical Deep-Dive: Specifications for each
5. CTA: "See Services That Support These Products" → Services

### Services Page → Operational Support
**Current**: Service catalog
**New**: Journey-based organization

**Structure:**
1. Hero: "Complete Operational Support"
2. Operational Journey:
   - **Discovery & Assessment** → ROV Inspection
   - **Precision Mapping** → 3D Photogrammetry
   - **Intelligence & Planning** → Ocean Data Services
   - **Safety & Compliance** → Safety Standards
3. Subscription Model: Predictable operations
4. How Services Support Products: Integration story
5. CTA: "Explore Products That Enable These Services" → Products

## Storytelling Elements

### Emotional Hooks
- **Safety**: "Every dive is a calculated risk. We reduce that risk."
- **Precision**: "When millimeters matter, we deliver."
- **Mission-Critical**: "Operations don't wait. Neither do we."
- **Trust**: "Defense agencies trust us. So should you."

### Problem-Solution Language

**Instead of**: "BlackBox is speech-to-text software"
**Say**: "Communication breakdowns cost lives. BlackBox ensures every word is captured, even in extreme conditions."

**Instead of**: "ROV Inspection service"
**Say**: "Inspect without risking divers. Get comprehensive data faster, safer, cheaper."

**Instead of**: "Melon Scout AUV"
**Say**: "Autonomous operations that work when humans can't. Deploy, collect, return—all without a diver in the water."
